A collection of projects from my experience as a Biostatistics/Bioinformatics fellow at NIOSH. 

Nano projects use rodent and human data following exposure to inhaled nano-scale Zinc oxide and other nanomaterials. These are used to estimate the hazard of inhaled nanomaterials to human workers.
DSU projects utilize noise and hearing data across several industries to investigate any potential relationships between exposure to noise (and/or solvents) and hearing loss.
