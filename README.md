A collection of projects from my experience as a Biostatistics/Bioinformatics fellow at NIOSH. 

<br>**Data Cleaning (R):** Data cleaning of OSHA noise and solvent exposure data and audiometric hearing loss data.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>R packages used include:</ins> tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2, tidyr, and patchwork

**Model Averaging with ToxicR (R):** Model averaging continuous dose-response data for the                                                     estimation of benchmark doses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Package used:</ins> ToxicR

**ZnO Plots and Tests (R):** Investigation of human and rodent inhalational zinc oxide exposure. Detailed and interactive exposure vs. response plots and a method for combining sample standard deviations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Packages used include:</ins> ggplot2, stats, plotly

**MWCNT Plots and Tests (R):** Investigation of rodent inhalational exposure and in-vitro cellular exposure to multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Detailed plots of exposure vs. response and benchmark dose vs. cell type, and Kruskal-Wallis tests for significant differences between benchmark doses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Packages used include:</ins> ggplot2, stats

**Python EDA (Python):** A prelminary exploratory data analysis of OSHA noise and solvent exposure data. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Packages used include:</ins> seaborn, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Modules used include:</ins> os and matplotlib.pyplot
